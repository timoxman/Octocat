What is a branch?
Well on a tree and you have a trunk and bits of wood sticking out of this these are the branches. Some branches from the trunk have further branches coming off them.. In Git branches are just the same. The 'Head' is the equivalent of the trunk and then as you make a copy of code which deviates from this, this is a branch and as with trees you can have branches off of branches. Branches allow you to have parallel development streams and to try ideas out without mucking up the main version (which could be running live)
